Window and Background:
- Creates an 800x800 pixel window
- White background

Circles:
- Two intersecting circles with equal radius of 200 units
- Left circle drawn with blue outline
- Right circle drawn with red outline
- Circles intersect at their diameter (distance between centers equals radius)
- Both circles have a stroke weight of 2.0 units and no fill

Points and Labels:
- All points are marked with small black circles of radius 4.0 units
- Left circle center labeled 'A'
- Right circle center labeled 'B'
- Top intersection point labeled 'C'
- Bottom intersection point labeled 'D'
- Center point of intersection labeled 'O'
- Point 'E' is where vertical line through A is tangent to left circle at top
- Point 'F' is where vertical line through A is tangent to left circle at bottom
- Point 'G' is where vertical line through B is tangent to right circle at top
- Point 'H' is where vertical line through B is tangent to right circle at bottom

Lines:
- Thin black line connecting points A and B (horizontal)
- Thin black line connecting points C and D (vertical)
- Vertical line through A intersects circle at tangent points E (top) and F (bottom)
- Vertical line through B intersects circle at tangent points G (top) and H (bottom)
- Horizontal line EG is tangent to both circles at their top points
- Horizontal line FH is tangent to both circles at their bottom points
- Note: Lines EG and FH do not pass through points C and D respectively
- All lines have stroke weight of 1.0 units

Mathematical Properties:
- Distance between circle centers equals the radius (creating true vesica piscis)
- Height of intersection points (C and D) calculated using the formula: √(r² - (d/2)²)
  where r is the radius and d is the distance between centers
- Point R is defined as the intersection of the x-axis with an arc from point G centered at O
  The x-coordinate of R is calculated as: r * sin(acos(r/d/2)) where r is radius and d is distance
- The Golden Ratio (φ) = (1 + √5) / 2 ≈ 1.618033988749895
  This divine proportion appears throughout nature and is considered aesthetically pleasing
  It represents a ratio where (a + b)/a = a/b, where a is the longer segment

Label Positioning:
- All labels are black text with 20pt font size
- Point labels (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, O) are placed next to their respective points
- Square root labels must be positioned precisely:
  * √2 label: Positioned on GA line, halfway between point A and the GA-CD intersection
  * √3 label: Positioned on CD line, below the origin O to avoid overlap
  * √5 label: Positioned on GF line, between points O and F
- Each square root label must sit directly on its corresponding line
- No label should overlap with any other label or line
- Labels must be clearly readable and maintain adequate spacing from all geometric elements

Square Construction:
- The vertical lines through A and B, combined with horizontal tangent lines EG and FH,
  form a rectangle that demonstrates the relationship between these square roots
- The rectangle is formed by lines tangent to the circles, not through intersection points
